# Thanks for using lightcurver!
# A word of warning, please do not expect this package to work on your data from the first go.
# It is very difficult to build a pipeline agnostic of the underlying data, especially in astronomy.
# this pipeline works well with repeated, seeing limited, wide-field astronomical images.
# Expect it to work best when you have an "intermediate" number density of stars in the field.
# Too few and we cannot calibrate the frames properly. Too many and finding isolated stars becomes difficult.
# Anyway, below you will find parameters used by the package in order of the execution of tasks.
#
# The parameters herein work with te dataset provided in the tutorial: 
# https://duxfrederic.github.io/lightcurver/tutorial/

#################################################### Import ############################################################
# First, define the working directory where the files will be copied (after cropping, conversion, sky subtraction ...)
workdir: /scratch/lightcurver_tutorial 
# Then, list directories in which we are to look for your images. (no securities in place for filtering
# files that are not images)
raw_dirs:
  - /scratch/lightcurver_tutorial/raw

# we can trim the images upon importation, in pixels. Useful if your images are big and the ROI is
# near the center always. Default 0 pixel trimmed.
trim_vertical: 0
trim_horizontal: 0

# some processes can be parallelized, especially in the initial steps that do not use the GPU
# limit how many subprocesses we can run in parallel here.
multiprocessing_cpu_count: 1




##################################### Region of Interest and Telescope #################################################
# now we define our Region of Interest (ROI)
# the ROI will be extracted, and have flux calibrated cutouts prepared.
# please keep the formatting the same.
ROI:
  J0248: 
    coordinates: [42.2031, 19.22528]  # [ra, dec] in degrees
ROI_size: 3.5  # in arcseconds, will not consider reference stars this close
# the ROI also will be used as a position starting point for the plate solving.
# frames that do not contain it (determined after plate solving) will not undergo further processing.

# telescope information.
# will be used to calculate airmass, distance to moon, this type of stuff.
telescope:
  name: VST
  latitude: -24.6
  longitude: -70.4
  elevation: 2635.0
  imager_name: OmegaCAM




############################################# Background estimation ####################################################

# We need to very precisley subtract the background. The quality of the photometry depends immensely on this.
# `sep` does a great job at this, but we offer the possibility to first mask the sources before estimating the
# background (in case of crowded fields)
mask_sources_before_background: false
# also, if you have strong gradients, you might want to allow your image to be subdivided in more boxes.
background_estimation_n_boxes: 10
# (this is how many boxes we divide the side of the image in, so in total there'll be the square of this number boxes)



################################################# Plate Solving ########################################################

# Mainly for the purpose of plate solving, we try and find stars.
# we will use `sep` for this purpose, here you can define the two main parameters of sep.
source_extraction_threshold: 2.0
source_extraction_min_area: 20
# do you want to do plots of the extracted sources?
source_extraction_do_plots: 1



# Ok, everyhing plate solving now.
# Are your images already plate solved? if yes, we will skip the plate solving step
already_plate_solved: 1
# plate solving strategy: plate solve with astrometry.net (`plate_solve`) or try and match the image detections
# with gaia stars (`alternate_gaia_solve`)
# I recommend the first one for most cases.
plate_solving_strategy: 'plate_solve'

# this is a plate scale interval to speed up the plate solving, 
# you can make it more precise if you know the plate scale of your instrument. 
# In arcseconds per pixel.
plate_scale_interval: [0.2, 0.23]

# if the plate solving is to be made with gaia, you need the following argument as well:
# this is the radius in which to query (all) gaia stars around the ROI, in arcseconds.
alternate_plate_solve_gaia_radius: 180

# still for the plate solving, we are going to use my wrapper around Astrometry.net:
# widefield_plate_solver
# It can either use a local installation (solve-field command in path)
# or the astrometry.net api. We will try to use the local installation
# if the astrometry api key below is null.
# else we'll use the API.
astrometry_net_api_key: null

# after plate solving, we can check the anisotropy of the pixels (a bad astrometric solution can have
# unexpectedly anisotropic pixels)
max_pixel_anisotropy: 2e-2
# images beyond this threshold will be eliminated (with comment 'suspicious_plate_solved')
# by the way, inevitably some images are not solvable. Please define the loss fraction you deem acceptable here.
plate_solving_min_success_fraction: 0.85
# if you notice your images are really low in quality (terrible seeing, high sky, bad pointings ...")
# and identify this as the reason of the plate solving failing, you can execute this database query:
# 'update frames set comment='cannot be plate solved', eliminated = 1 where plate_solved=0;'
# (after sqlite3 $workdir/database.sqlite3)
# we will not try to plate solve those anymore.



########################################## Selection of reference stars ################################################

# Now, the selection of calibration stars.
# We can either focus on the footprint common to all images, the idea being stability across
# epochs in both the PSF model and normalization coefficient.
# Only works with stable pointings obviously, and recommended only if you plan on reducing the dataset once
# (because each new frame will change the footprint, and trigger the computation of all the downstream steps again)
# param name: 'common_footprint_stars'
# The other possibility is looking for stars close to the ROI: ROI_disk. This offers a stable footprint,
# so you can add more frames and only the downstream steps on the new frames will execute.
# in summary: 'common_footprint_stars', or 'ROI_disk'
# I recommend the latter, seems to work well.
star_selection_strategy: 'ROI_disk'
# So, if the above is 'ROI_disk', provide here the radius in arcseconds:
ROI_disk_radius_arcseconds: 300
# if your field is absolutely crowded with stars, use a much smaller radius.
# Try and aim for a radius that will yield about 20-30 stars.

# Of course, depending on your setup you will need to probe a different range
# of magnitudes to both provide high S/N constraints to your normalization and PSF models,
# while avoiding saturation  -- set to null for no contraints
star_min_gmag: 16.0
star_max_gmag: 20.0

# we also do not consider stars that were not well-fitted by a point source solution in gaia
# (could be galaxies, or very crowded fields, or doubles ...which we need to avoid)
# set to null for no constraints
star_max_astrometric_excess_noise: 3.0

# finally, we can also request a small photometric error,
# as the photometric error will go up with variability. this way we can select
# more stable stars.
star_max_phot_g_mean_flux_error: 3.0

# Some absolute minimum number of stars criterion -- will crash if under this.
min_number_stars: 6

# and whether we query again ...can be necessary sometimes.
gaia_query_redo: false

# each good star is then named with a single letter, by ascending distance from the ROI.
# if more than 26, names will include 'aa', 'ab', etc. --> then switch to a list instead of a string.
# these stars will be used for the PSF model and normalization.
# if null: uses the top 10 closest stars to the ROI.
# if an integer N: select the top N closest stars to the ROI.
stars_to_use_psf: null
stars_to_use_norm: null



############################################## Extraction of cutouts ###################################################

# We are now ready to extract cutouts, of all the stars and of our ROI. -- squares of size defined below in pixels.
stamp_size_stars: 24
stamp_size_ROI: 32
redo_stamp_extraction: false
clean_cosmics: true



################################################ PSF models ############################################################
# Now we have nice stars, hopefully the type that will yield a nice PSF model. We also know
# which frame has which star in its footprint, so we are ready to build a PSF model.
# STARRED will do it, here are some parameters you can tweak but that hopefully constitute reasonable defaults.
redo_psf: false
subsampling_factor: 2
psf_n_iter_analytic: 100 # number of iterations (l-bfgs-b) spent fitting a moffat
psf_n_iter_pixels: 3000 # number of iterations (adabelief) spent fitting the pixel grid.



############################################### Star photometry ########################################################
# Now we do photometry of stars using our PSF models.
# At this point we also have saved a chi2 value for each PSF fit.
# Thus, we can filter the bad fits by comparing the chi2 values.
# Either we do not reject anything: psf_fit_exclude_strategy set to null.
# Or, we can sigma clip the chi2 values and exclude the tails.
# This is the one I recommend, it takes a parameter as follows:
psf_fit_exclude_strategy:
    sigma_clip: 4 # from how many sigma from the median do we exclude?
# last possibility, just bounds you choose on the chi2.
# (uncomment both lines below, and comment the two lines just above if this is the one you want to use)
#psf_fit_exclude_strategy:
#    threshold: [0, 1.5] # range of values of chi2 that we keep.

# after selection of the PSFs we want to move forward with, some parameters of the star photometry:
redo_star_photometry: false
star_deconv_n_iter: 2000



########################################### Normalization Coefficient ##################################################
# Ready to calculate a normalization coefficient!
# We exclude the measured star fluxes we do not trust. same as for the PSF above.
fluxes_fit_exclude_strategy:
  sigma_clip: 3.0




########################################## Calibrated cutouts of ROI ###################################################

# and finally! the preparation of the ROI. This will prepare an hdf5 file with flux calibrated cutouts and noisemaps,
# as well as PSFs. (all as large numpy arrays, ready for use with starred).
# the hdf5 will also contain some identifiers (database frame id, mjd, seeing, etc.)

# Before proceeding, we provide another chance of eliminating more frames.
# You can filter on any column of the 'frames' table of the sqlite3 database.
# This is the structure you should use:
constraints_on_frame_columns_for_roi:
  seeing_arcseconds: [0.0, 3.0]
#  sky_level_electron_per_second: [0., 1000.]
#  ellipticity: [0.0, 0.5]


# where do you want your prepared cutouts? (a single hdf5 file)
# by default, null --> "$workdir/prepared_roi_cutouts"
prepared_roi_cutouts_path: null
# now you can load up the cutouts and do a starred deconvolution.
# TODO prepare example notebooks and scripts
# in the meantime see starred repo for examples.



################################################ Modelling the ROI #######################################################
# this is where we model the calibrated cutouts we struggled to prepare until now.
# for most cases, I would use the h5 file produced and reduce it in a jupyter notebook with starred.
# (because this is the satisfying part)
# if you are running this as a pipeline, you can:
# - give below the astrometry of your point sources
# - optionally, give a pre-optimized background to use as a starting point (path to a fits or npy file)
# - decide if you want to further optimize the said background.
do_ROI_model: true
point_sources: #  'label: [ra, dec]'
   A: [42.202991, 19.225400]
   B: [42.202944, 19.225186]
   C: [42.203227, 19.225010]
   D: [42.203249, 19.225389]

# so, null or a path for this one (path either relative to workdir, or absolute path starting with /):
starting_background: null
# if null above, and false here, then you will not include a background (kinda ruining the point of the entire pipeline, but well...)
further_optimize_background: true

# and these should mostly work as is, how many iterations of the optimizer do we do?
roi_deconv_translations_iters: 300
roi_deconv_all_iters: 2000
# keep in mind that this is going to be relatively slow on a CPU. Count 30min at least for the whole pipeline.
