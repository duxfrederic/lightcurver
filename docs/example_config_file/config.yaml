# now we define our Region of Interest (ROI)
# the ROI will be extracted, and have flux calibrated cutouts prepared.

# the ROI will be used as a position starting point for the plate solving.

# plate solving strategy: plate solve all, or plate solve one and align the others 
# onto the first one.
# possibilities: 'plate_solve_all', 'plate_solve_then_align'
# I recomment the first one, it'll be a bit slower ...but also more robust to
# variations in the pointing.

# In arcseconds per pixel.

# now for the plate solving, we are going to use my wrapper around Astrometry.net:
# widefield_plate_solver
# It can either use a local installation (solve-field command in path)
# or the astrometry.net api. We will try to use the local installation
# if the astrometry api key below is null.
# else we'll use the API.
